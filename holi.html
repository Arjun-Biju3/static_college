It is one of the most important festivals in the country. It is also famous as the ‘Festival of Colours’ in the different parts of India. People of other religions celebrate this festival with equal enthusiasm and enjoyment together.

        In Holi, there is a tradition of splashing watercolours on others. Children celebrate it with ‘Pichkari’ which is like a water gun. In the evening, people meet with their friends and relatives to make the celebration more memorable and enjoyable.</p>
